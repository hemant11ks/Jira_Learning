Notes:

1. ðŸ“š What is the Jira REST API?
The Jira REST API lets you communicate with a Jira project through HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
Instead of using the Jira web interface manually, you can programmatically create issues, update them, search, delete, etc..

Itâ€™s useful for:

Automating Jira operations (like creating tasks automatically).

Integrating Jira with other systems (CI/CD, Slack bots, etc.)

Bulk updates or reports.

 How the Jira REST API works
HTTP Methods used:

GET â†’ Fetch data (e.g., list of issues)

POST â†’ Create something (e.g., a new issue)

PUT â†’ Update something (e.g., edit issue details)

DELETE â†’ Remove something (e.g., delete an issue)

Authentication:

Basic Auth (email + API Token)

OAuth (more complex, for apps)

Bearer Token (modern, secure)

Jira requires authentication for almost all API calls.

Python and Jira REST API: Basic Setup
You can call Jira API using:

requests module (manual way)

OR the jira Python library (easier way)
